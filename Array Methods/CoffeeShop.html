    Exercise1: Simulating a Coffee Shop Queue with a Loop

    1. Define an array named coffeeQueue containing a list of customer names in the order they arrive:
    "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dana", and "Eli".
    2. Use a while loop to simulate serving each customer one by one.
        - Remove the first customer from the queue using the correct method.
        - Print the name of the customer to indicate they have been served.
    3. After each customer is served, print the updated queue to show which customers are still waiting in line.
    4. Repeat until the queue is empty.

        // Step 1: Define an array with customer names in the coffee shop queue
        let coffeeQueue = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dana", "Eli"];

        // Step 2: Serve each customer until the queue is empty
        while (coffeeQueue.length > 0) {
            let servedCustomer = coffeeQueue.shift();  // Remove the first customer from the queue

            // Step 3: Print the name of the served customer
            console.log("Served:", servedCustomer);  // Outputs each served customer's name

            // Step 4: Print the remaining queue
            console.log("Waiting Customers:"+ coffeeQueue);  // Shows remaining customers in the queue
        }
