    Exercise3. Simulates a person going through their morning routine step by step until all tasks are finished.

    Instructions:

    1. Define an array named morningRoutine containing the following morning tasks: "wake up", "brush teeth", "shower", "eat breakfast", and "go to work".
    2. Use a loop to remove and complete each task one by one.
        - Remove the first task from the array using the correct method.
        - Print the name of the completed task.
    5. After each task is completed, print the remaining tasks to show what is left in the morning routine.
        - Continue until all tasks are completed and the array is empty.

        for (let i = 0; i < morningRoutine.length; i++) {
            let completedTask = morningRoutine.shift(); // Removes the first task from the list
            console.log("Completed Task:", completedTask); // Outputs the completed task
